In the first week of the winter semester I learned some basic knowledge about more useful software. In the tutorial there was a detailed and clear demonstration about the installation of LaTeX. This is a powerful document preparation system for automatically formatting the articles, which can make them organized and stable. In my future work I believe it will be widely used in my reports and resume.  \par
We also went through some commands of git in the tutorial. It is a version control tool like SVN I used in the last semester. By committing and rushing I can update and save the changes on files to the gitlab.\par
In the assignment I worked on how to read data from files with python. The main idea is use the function readlines and save the data in each line in a dictionary. I also need to sort the dictionaries according to the value of gpa.
